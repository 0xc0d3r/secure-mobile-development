# Secure Mobile Development

At NowSecre we spend a lot of time attacking mobile apps. Hacking. Breaking encryption, finding flaws, pen testing and looking for sensitive data stored insecurely. We do it for the right reasons - to help companies make their apps more secure. This document represents some of the wisdom we share with our clients and partners. **We are driven to advance mobile security worldwide.**

## Using this Guide

This guide gives specific recommendations to use during your development process. The descriptions of attacks and security recommendations in this report are not exhaustive or perfect, but you will get practical advice that you can use to make your app(s) more secure.
