# Implement Touch ID Properly

## Details 

Touch ID is commonly known for its use in allowing a user to authenticate to and unlock their device without entering a passcode. Some developers also use Touch ID to allow the user to authenticate to their app using a stored device fingerprint.

When a developer implements Touch ID in their app, they typically do so in one of two ways:

1. Using only the Local Authentication framework to authenticate the user
  1. This method leaves the authentication mechanism vulnerable to bypass
  2. An attacker can modify the local check at runtime, or by patching the binary. This is done by overriding the `LAContextevaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply` method implementation
2. Using Keychain access control lists (ACLs)

## Remediation

When using Touch ID for authentication, store the appâ€™s secret in the Keychain with an ACL assigned to that item. With this method, iOS performs a user presence check before reading and returning Keychain items to the app. Developers can find sample code on the Apple website at [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/KeychainTouchID/Listings/KeychainTouchID_AAPLKeychainTestsViewController_m.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/KeychainTouchID/Listings/KeychainTouchID_AAPLKeychainTestsViewController_m.html).
