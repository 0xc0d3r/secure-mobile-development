## Details 

Intents are used for inter-component signaling and can be used

 * *To start an Activity, typically opening a user interface for an app*
 * *As broadcasts to inform the system and apps of changes*
 * *To start, stop, and communicate with a background service*
 * *To access data via ContentProviders*
 * *As callbacks to handle events*

Improper implementation could result in data leakage, restricted functions being called and program flow being manipulated.

## Remediation

 * Components accessed via Intents can be public or private. The default is dependent on the intent-filter and it is easy to mistakenly allow the component to be or become public. It is possible to set component as android:exported=false in the appâ€™s Manifest to prevent this.
 
 * Public components declared in the Manifest are by default open so any application can access them. If a component does not need to be accessed by all other apps, consider setting a permission on the component declared in the Manifest.

 * Data received by public components cannot be trusted and must be scrutinized.
