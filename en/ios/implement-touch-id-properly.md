# Implement Touch ID Properly

## Details

Touch ID is commonly known for its use in allowing a user to authenticate to and unlock their device without entering a passcode. Some developers also use Touch ID to allow the user to authenticate to their app using a stored device fingerprint.

When a developer implements Touch ID in their app, they typically do so in one of two ways:

1. Using only the Local Authentication framework to authenticate the user.
    * This method leaves the authentication mechanism vulnerable to bypass.
    * An attacker can modify the local check at runtime, or by patching the binary. This is done by overriding the `LAContextevaluatePolicy:localizedReason:reply` method implementation.
2. Using Keychain access control lists (ACLs).

## Remediation

When using Touch ID for authentication, store the appâ€™s secret in the Keychain with an ACL assigned to that item. With this method, iOS performs a user presence check before reading and returning Keychain items to the app. Developers can find sample code on the Apple website at [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/KeychainTouchID/Listings/KeychainTouchID_AAPLKeychainTestsViewController_m.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/KeychainTouchID/Listings/KeychainTouchID_AAPLKeychainTestsViewController_m.html).
