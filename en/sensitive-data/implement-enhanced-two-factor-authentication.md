# Implement Enhanced / Two-Factor Authentication

## Details 

Weak or non-existent authentication can grant an attacker unauthorized access to an app.

## Remediation

A password should not be simplistic. Itâ€™s best to require, if not at least support, complex passwords, including length of at least six alphanumeric characters (more characters is always stronger). Requiring the selection of a secret word or icon (which the user does not create themselves) as part of the log-in process can help protect users' accounts in the event they re-use passwords and their password was exposed as part of another data compromise.

In some cases, a username and password does not provide sufficient security for a mobile app. When sensitive data or transactions are involved, implement two-factor authentication. This may not be feasible every time a user logs in but can be used at intervals or when accessing selected functions. Consider step-up authentication methods to provide normal access to non-transactional areas but require a second layer of authentication for sensitive functions.

Options for enhanced authentication include:

* Additional secret word/icon
* Additional code provided by SMS or email -- but beware that an attacker will likely have access to both on a stolen device
* Password plus additional user-known value, for example user-selected personal factor
* Security questions and answers, selected by the user in advance (e.g. during registration)

For the highest level of security, use one-time passwords that require the user to not only possess the correct credentials, but also a physical token including the one time password.
